                            <p>After I quit my previous job to focus on enhancing my web development skills to start my
                                career in that field, I needed a job to fund my living basics, therefore, I worked in
                                commerce by selling different products to different customers. This experience taught me
                                the skills of communicating with buyers and convincing them, and always providing
                                products of good quality alongside excellent service which always leaded to satisfied

                            <h3>Bilingual Customer Care Service Representative</h3>
                            <p>Along with my MSc studies I worked as a customer care representative, technical, and
                                back-office agent at the Sitel call center, representing “OneTouch/LifeScan”. I
                                handled English and French calls from Canadian customers for 2
                                years. My tasks were handling software calls, emails, outbound, and inbound calls. I
                                started this experience as an intermediate in English, but after 2 years of
                                communication with native people, I became very advanced in the English language. I also
                                explored new skills that were in me but did not pay attention to until I practiced them
                                in reality - with the testimony of my colleagues - such as the ability to adapt to new
                                work environments, thinking out of the box to solve customer's problem, dedication and
                                attention to details to explore complex problems, patient, professional, always
                                willing to help others, lead team to the success, and more. I believe that those
                                skills will be an advantage and a positive addition to any environment, and I intend to
                                hone those skills and give more to my next company.</p>

                            <p>I started my first online training in graphic design, in 2018. After gaining a fine
                                knowledge in the field, I started practicing by designing flyers for societies.
                                Moreover, I worked in POD (Print On Demand) in RedBubble. Working as a graphic made me
                                gain some important skills that are helping me as a Web Developer, such as being
                                proficient in design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, a solid grasp of
                                color theory and typography, enhancing my attention to detail, Layout design, and web
                                design skills.</p>
